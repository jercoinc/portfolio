    <h3>The adventure begins...</h3>

    <p id="site-description">At the end of June 2018, I was laid off from a computer programming
    job where I had served for 23 years. I was a successful Java
    programmer of non-web projects but had always desired to learn more.
    Now I have the time to train and learn web programming with Java and
    JavaScript. I had taken web classes before, but I never had the time to
    apply what I had learned in the work place. I am using this opportunity
    to train so I will have additional, valuable skills to offer a prospective
    employers.
