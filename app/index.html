<h3>The adventure begins...</h3>

<p>At the end of June 2018, I was laid off from a computer programming
job where I had served for 23 years. I was a successful Java
programmer of non-web projects but had always desired to learn more.
Now I have the time to train and learn web programming with Java and
JavaScript. I had taken web classes before, but I never had the time to
apply what I had learned in the work place. I am using this opportunity
to train so I will have additional, valuable skills to offer a prospective
employer.
