    <h1 class=site-top--title>The Adventure begins...</h1>

    <p id="site-top--description">At the end of June 2018, I was laid off from a computer programming
    job where I had served for 23 years. I was a successful Java
    programmer of non-web projects but had always desired to learn more.
    Now I have the time to train and learn web programming with Java and
    JavaScript. I had taken web classes before, but I never had the time to
    apply what I had learned in the work place. I am using this opportunity
    to train so I will have additional, valuable skills to offer a prospective
    employers. This is the beginning of my adventure.

        I completed the Udemy Course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/">
          <i>Mastering the Modern Workflow</i></a>
        by Brad Schiff. This class gives a good introduction to Git, GitHub,
        Node.js, NPM, Object-oriented JavaScript, ES6, webpack, Gulp, and
        BEM. This course is a great starting place for beginning front end
        programming. I also started classes on freeCodeCamp. I completed
        Basic HTML5 and CSS classes toward Responsive Web Design
        Certification.
