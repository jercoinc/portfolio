            The Challenge
          </h3>
          <p>
            I was challenged by a company to build a small project. This project
            would involve using some new technologies, and it was a test to see
            what I could do. I was very interested in using this new technology
            and was excited to add it to my project list.<br />
          </p>
          <h3 class="headline">
            The Instructions
          </h3>
          <p>
            Create a basic website that shows launch data for SpaceX rocket
            missions in a grid/table.
            <br />Your web application should:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Display the date and time of each mission, the rocket name, a link
              to the cargo manifest, and whether the launch was a success.
            </li>
            <li>
              Display the time of the mission in Central Time (CT).
            </li>
            <li>
              Order the launches in reverse chronological order.
            </li>
            <li>
              For each launch, include a column that ranks the payload mass,
              with the heaviest payload being rank 1.
            </li>
            <li>
              Work in any modern browser (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, IE10+, Safari,
              etc.).
            </li>
            <li>Use the React JavaScript framework.<br />&nbsp</li>
          </ul>

            My Story
          </h3>
          <p>
            I have a background in Java Core and Visual Basic. I had just
            finished Centriq Training, learning Full Stack web development with
            .Net. I had one other course in web technologies the used NodeJS. I
            have some good skills, but this project was definitely challenging
            every step of the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I started, I chose AG-Grid as my grid product. The recommended
            grid product only came with a 30 day free trial. Since I wanted this
            project on my website for more 30 days, I went with a product that
            had a community version.
          </p>
          <p>
            The requesting company gave me more time for the project. They
            wanted me to see if I could replicate my HTML version in React with
            a table, without AG-Grid.<br />&nbsp
          </p>

            My Timeline
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Friday Afternoon</strong> – I received the challenge and
              started looking at the data in Json format and working on the
              Javascript call to retrieve the data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sunday</strong> – I decided to make sure I could complete
              all the data requirements, so I built a version out of HTML which
              I have displayed on the website.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monday</strong> – I finished the HTML version. I started
              working with NodeJS and React.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tuesday</strong> – I finished working with various grid
              products in the morning and settled on AG-Grid. I figured how to
              get a React program deployed on my website.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Wednesday</strong> – I hit the wall. I started to work
              with the way React handles Json. This is where all the problems
              occurred, probably because I have never worked with React or JSX.
              From what I have seen, React will load the Json and store it in
              the State. The issue is, the SpaceX data had lots of changes that
              needed to take place before the grid displayed it. All examples of
              setState were basic and would not come close to what I needed to
              do. Some of the setState examples never worked in my React
              program. I spent a couple of hours building and playing with a
              REST API with express. I wanted to see if I could filter the
              SpaceX data. It was apparent that this was not the right way to
              go. Time to call it a day and go with the fields I could display
              without issues. I realized this project required much more time
              and knowledge. I contacted the company for further instruction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Friday</strong> –The requesting company gave me more time
              to complete the project without using AG-Grid.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monday</strong> – I reviewed several YouTube React
              lectures. I removed AG-Grid. I ran into issues with the current
              code not wanting to load the SpaceX data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tuesday</strong> – I fixed the SpaceX data loading issue.
              Got UTC time, flight number, mission name, rocket name and launch
              status added to the table.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Wednesday</strong> - Payload mass calculation and cargo
              manifest added to the table. I had issues with displaying HTML in
              React. I researched and added NPM package ReactHtmlParser. I had
              issues with building the rank table and getting functions to see
              the data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Thursday</strong> – I adjusted date/time to display local
              time. I finished the rank table by adding it to the State so
              functions could process it. I wrapped up the website and code.<br />&nbsp
            </li>
          </ul>

            Conclusion
          </h3>
          <p>
            This was a really cool challenge, and I am grateful for the
            opportunity to take on this project. I was able to complete the
            project successfully. At first, I was unable to get AG-Grid to do
            some of the more complex work, but I was completely successful using
            a HTML table in React. It was very apparent this project would have
            flowed smoother if I had previous experience in using React. I am
            looking forward to taking classes to acquire this knowledge for
            future projects.
